The solution involves adding spaces between the percentage value and the other unit in the `calc()` function.  The correct code would be:

```css
width: calc(50% - 10px);
```
By adding spaces between `50%` and `-10px`, the browser can properly interpret the calculation, ensuring that the width is correctly calculated as 50% of the container's width minus 10 pixels.  Without the spaces, the browser may encounter parsing errors or unexpected calculations.
