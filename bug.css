The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentage values and other units. For example, the following code might not produce the expected result: `width: calc(50% - 10px);` The issue is that the `calc()` function needs to have a clear separation between the percentage and other units, specifically in this case, using spaces between the `50%` and `-10px`.
